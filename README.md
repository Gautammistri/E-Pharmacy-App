# E-Pharmacy app

This application is a complete package of medicines in which a customer orders a medicine by 
registering himself first. Our application also provides diet plan for our users. User can get their 
regular required medicine from our application just by uploading medicine prescription according to 
the user requirement. This product mainly caters to the people living in remote areas who have no 
pharmacy near them.
